# EmergeCare - The future of Health Information Systems

EmergeCare is a healthcare system for people with chronic illnesses and may need emergency care in public, where by the patient can enter their medical details
in an app and have a QR code generated. They can then print that QR code and stick on a public place like on their phone case or car such that when in public or
around strangers, anybody can scan the QR code, get details about their condition and ways to give them emergency care.
